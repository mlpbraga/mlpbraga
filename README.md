----------------

Bachelor of Computer Science from the Federal University of Amazonas and master's student in computer science with a focus on Data Science and Natural Language Processing at the same university.

As an undergraduate student, I carried out scientific initiation projects (PIBICs) in the themes of "Correction of Noisy Texts Generated by OCR" and "Detection of Sexist Discourse in Comments on Social Networks", focusing on the areas of Information Retrieval and Data Science.

As a software developer, I worked for a year at Linx Impulse in the search team, maintaining web pages and REST APIs used by customers. Also worked at a startup named Calluma Tech as a full stack developer, on the architecture and maintenance of web pages, REST APIs, databases and mobile applications. Currently I'm working at a Meliuz as fullstack developer.
